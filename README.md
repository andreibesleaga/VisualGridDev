## üöÄ Overview
VisualGridDev is a next-generation, production-ready platform for universal AI agent orchestration, visual programming, and mesh deployment across cloud, edge, and hybrid environments. It unifies protocol compatibility, self-healing, extensibility, and compliance for enterprise-grade AI systems. This repository centralizes system architecture and protocols proposals.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights
- **Visual IDE:** Web-based, event-driven, LabVIEW-style programming (Node-RED, React, Monaco)
- **Universal Protocol:** AGCP protocol with 40+ bridges (A2A, MCP, HTTP, MQTT, gRPC, etc.)
- **Self-Healing:** MAPE-K feedback loops, adaptive security, and auto-remediation
- **Mesh Deployment:** Cloud, edge, and p2p with Kubernetes, Docker, and GitOps
- **Extensibility:** Hot-loadable plugins, schema importers, and manifest-based extension system
- **Agent Roles:** 70+ agent roles across 11 categories, fully documented
- **Monitoring:** Real-time dashboards, observability, and audit logs
- **Compliance:** Explicit mapping to EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, IEEE CertifAIEd, GDPR, SOC2, ISO 27001, HIPAA
- **Future-Proof:** Quantum, edge AI, 6G, and emerging tech ready
