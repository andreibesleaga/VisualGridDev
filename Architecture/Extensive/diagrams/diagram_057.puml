title Performance Monitoring and Optimization

participant "Application" as App
participant "Metrics Collector" as Collector
participant "Time Series DB" as TSDB
participant "Alert Manager" as AlertMgr
participant "Auto Scaler" as Scaler
participant "Performance Optimizer" as Optimizer

loop Every 15 seconds
    App -> Collector: Send metrics
    Collector -> TSDB: Store metrics
    TSDB -> AlertMgr: Check thresholds
    
    alt Performance degradation
        AlertMgr -> Scaler: Trigger scaling
        Scaler -> App: Scale resources
        AlertMgr -> Optimizer: Optimize performance
        Optimizer -> App: Apply optimizations
    end
end

note right of Collector : CPU, memory, latency,\nthroughput metrics
note right of Optimizer : Query optimization,\ncache tuning, resource allocation
