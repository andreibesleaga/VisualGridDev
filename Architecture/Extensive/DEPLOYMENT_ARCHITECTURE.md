## üõ°Ô∏è Self-Healing Deployment & Live Flow Activation

- All deployment targets (cloud, edge, hybrid) run a self-healing agent that:
  - Monitors node and agent health, resource usage, and protocol connectivity
  - Automatically restarts, migrates, or reconfigures workloads on failure
  - Supports hot-patching and live schema/plugin updates
  - Participates in mesh-wide health consensus and incident reporting

- Visual programming flows are deployed via orchestrators (Kubernetes, edge agent, etc.) and activated by self-healing agents on target nodes.
- Real-time feedback, health, and deployment status are streamed to the Visual IDE dashboard for live monitoring and troubleshooting.
- All monitoring data is available via API and can be integrated with external observability platforms.
