# Emerging Technologies & Future-Proofing

VisualGridDev is designed for extensibility and adaptability to emerging technologies and standards. This section summarizes current and planned support for next-generation tech.

## 1. Quantum Computing & Quantum-Safe Cryptography
- Pluggable quantum-safe encryption modules (planned)
- Protocol abstraction for quantum network integration

## 2. Edge AI & Federated Learning
- Native support for edge AI inference (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX, etc.)
- Federated learning and distributed model update flows
- Edge device orchestration and monitoring

## 3. 6G & Next-Gen Networking
- Protocol abstraction for 6G/next-gen wireless
- Adaptive mesh and ultra-low-latency routing

## 4. AI Model Hot-Swapping & Schema Importers
- Universal schema importer for new model types and protocols
- Hot-loading and live upgrade of AI/ML models and agent logic

## 5. Continuous Technology Watch
- Architecture review process for new standards and tech (annual)
- Roadmap for integration of new protocols, compliance, and security features
