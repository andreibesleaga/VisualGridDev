# AI Compliance Regulations Reference

This document summarizes the key requirements and controls for major AI regulations relevant to VisualGridDev, including the EU AI Act (2024), NIST AI Risk Management Framework (2024), and IEEE CertifAIEd (2023+). It is intended to supplement the main architecture documentation and support audit readiness.

## 1. EU AI Act (2024)
- Risk-based classification (Unacceptable, High, Limited, Minimal)
- Mandatory risk management, data governance, transparency, human oversight, robustness, cybersecurity, and accuracy controls for high-risk systems
- Registration of high-risk AI in the EU database
- Conformity assessment and post-market monitoring
- Data residency and cross-border transfer compliance

## 2. NIST AI Risk Management Framework (2024)
- Four core functions: Govern, Map, Measure, Manage
- Emphasis on trustworthy AI: valid, reliable, safe, secure, explainable, privacy-enhanced, fair, accountable, transparent, and resilient
- Continuous risk assessment and mitigation
- Documentation and traceability of AI lifecycle

## 3. IEEE CertifAIEd (2023+)
- Certification for transparency, accountability, algorithmic bias, privacy, and security
- Emphasis on human-centric and ethical AI
- Ongoing monitoring and recertification

## 4. Data Residency & Sovereignty
- Explicit controls for data location, regional storage, and cross-border transfer
- Support for EU, US, and APAC data residency requirements

## 5. Security Standards
- SOC2, ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, GDPR, HIPAA, and other sectoral standards
