# 2. Architecture Overview

## System Context
- **Actors**: Developers, Admins, IoT Devices, Cloud Platforms
- **Systems**: VisualGridDev Studio, Mesh Grid, AI/ML Pipelines, Event Streaming Backbone

## Architecture Principles
- MAPE-K feedback loops
- Decentralized, protocol-agnostic messaging
- Visual-first development
- Cloud-native scalability

## üõ°Ô∏è Self-Healing, Extensibility, and Real-Time Monitoring

- All system nodes (cloud, edge, hybrid) run self-healing agents for health monitoring, auto-remediation, and live schema/plugin updates.
- Visual programming flows are deployed to any environment and activated by self-healing agents, with real-time feedback to the Visual IDE.
- Universal extension/plugin system allows hot-loading of new protocols, agents, and features at runtime.
- Real-time monitoring dashboards in the Visual IDE provide live status, health, and deployment feedback for all nodes and flows.
- System is future-proofed for quantum, edge AI, 6G, and unknown tech via schema importer and compatibility layer.
