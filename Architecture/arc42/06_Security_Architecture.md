# 6. Security Architecture

## Trust Boundaries
- Agent-to-Agent: mTLS
- Device-to-Agent: Encrypted + Signed
- IDE Access: OAuth2 + JWT

## Identity Management
- X.509 per agent
- RBAC policies for admin/developer roles
- Signed workflows and encrypted messages

## Threat Mitigations
- Certificate rotation
- Secure bootstrap
- Attack surface minimization at edges

## üõ°Ô∏è Security for Extensibility, Self-Healing, and Compliance

- All extensions/plugins are signed, validated, and sandboxed at runtime.
- Self-healing agents enforce security policies, monitor for anomalies, and auto-remediate threats.
- Compliance hooks (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) are integrated into deployment and monitoring flows.
- Real-time security status and alerts are streamed to the Visual IDE dashboard.
- All system upgrades and schema imports are versioned, auditable, and can be rolled back.
