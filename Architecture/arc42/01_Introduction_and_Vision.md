# 1. Introduction & Vision

VisualGridDev is a next-generation platform designed to unify visual programming, decentralized agent networks, edge AI, and cloud-native infrastructure. The goal is to build an evolutionary, self-healing system that uses AI agents and agentic programming, that adapts and scales across edge-to-cloud environments.

**Key Features of chosen tech stack:**
- Visual programming (Node-RED) - already proven opensource graphical programming language with extensive user base that has hardware and other systems integrations;
- Agent communication (A2A, MCP) - standard communication protocols between AI entities or AI and other systems;
- Local AI execution (SQLite-AI) - proven filebased SQL DB VM, combined with AI and embedded models, for best edge implementations;
- Real-time streaming (Apache Kafka) - proven standard pub/sub, systems data streaming;
- MAPE-K self-healing control loops - proven self-healing standard;
